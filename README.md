## Introduction üåü

<p align="justify"> Our team set out to solve a critical issue that Pakistan faces, an issue that threatens to rent asunder the very foundation of society if left untreated. Our application's objective was to assist addicts and the mentally ill who have been abandoned by society. We aimed to provide a platform accessible to anyone with an internet connection, breaking the barriers of geography and societal stigmatization. Through our web application, individuals can receive top-notch counseling and medical assistance to fight against their worst impulses and begin a new chapter in their lives.</p>

## Problem Statement ‚ùóÔ∏è

<p align="justify">Drug users and the mentally ill in Pakistan face stigmatization and a severe shortage of counseling services. The majority of the population resides in rural areas, far from the limited counseling centers located in major cities. Moreover, individuals hesitate to seek help due to the fear of being labeled as addicts or insane. Our main objective was to address these issues by providing a solution that offers remote access to counseling services while respecting user privacy.</p>

## Requirement Elicitation üìã

The two major barriers to entry that our clients face are physical access and perceptions. We aimed to overcome these barriers through our solution:

<p align="justify"/>1. Physical Access: By offering a web-based platform, we eliminated the need for individuals to travel to counseling centers. Users can access the services from anywhere with an internet connection.

<p align="justify"/>2. Perceptions: Our platform provides privacy and anonymity, ensuring that users can seek help without the fear of societal judgment. We prioritized user confidentiality throughout the communication process.

## Implementation Methodology üöÄ

<p align="justify"/>We implemented a comprehensive counseling web application using the Laravel framework. Our implementation followed an Agile methodology, allowing us to work on small sections of the project and test every detail thoroughly. We utilized PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and various database resources to create a robust and versatile application.

<p align="justify"/>The implementation process involved the following steps:

1. Getting familiar with Laravel and its ecosystem.
2. Designing and implementing the landing page and user interface.
3. Adding information pages, implementing communication features, and ensuring privacy.
4. Implementing video calling and meeting management features.
5. Styling, responsiveness challenges, and iterative improvement.
6. Collaboration, final touches, and ongoing support.

## Conclusion üéâ

<p align="justify"/>The development and implementation of our counseling web application using Laravel proved to be a challenging but rewarding process. We successfully addressed the barriers to accessing counseling services by providing a remote platform with user privacy as a priority. The application facilitates effective communication between users and counselors, offers information on addiction and mental illnesses, and presents a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

<p align="justify"/>As we continue to support and maintain the application, we remain committed to addressing user needs and expectations. We aim to enhance the user experience, improve the platform's effectiveness in providing support and guidance, and explore opportunities for further growth and development. Our ultimate goal is to make a significant positive impact on the lives of our users by offering a valuable and reliable resource for those in need of counseling and assistance.
